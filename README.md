# LIDAR
## Set-up
1. Run `git clone git@github.com:DixMilleJours/LIDAR.git` in your directory.
2. After that, open it locally. Run `git checkout -b replace_with_your_branch_name`. This creates your local branch.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This installs libraries needed. Remember to update `requirements.txt` if you add other libraries.
## Push your changes
1. Run `git status` to see the modified files.
2. If okay with the changes, run `git add .`
3. Then, run `git commit -m "a short msg to describe your change"`
4. Finally, run `git push`. Copy the command shown in the terminal to set upstream correctly.
5. If no copy option from step 4, just do `git push --set-upstream origin replace_with_your_branch`
